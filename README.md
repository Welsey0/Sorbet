- **Vanilla Compatible**
  - Sorbet is completely vanilla compatible and can therefore join any unmodded Minecraft server!
- **Enhanced SMP Features**
  - Mods like [REI](https://modrinth.com/mod/rei), [AppleSkin](https://modrinth.com/mod/appleskin), and more improve the experience on SMPs.
- **And More!**

## Understanding Versions
Sherbert version numbers are based on [Semantic Versioning](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-semantic-versioning/). The first digit entails the version of Minecraft. For example, versions made for 1.21.5 are 1.x.x while versions made for 1.21.6 will be 2.x.x. The second digit indicates changes to the modset. The third digit indicates changes to the configurations.

**Release** versions include all the mods on our list.\
**Beta** versions may be missing minor mods or functionality.\
**Alpha** versions were previously Release or Beta but were downgraded due to an issue in the version. We will note the cause in the changelogs. Avoid these!
